APPLE PUBLIC SOURCE LICENSE Version 2.0 -  August 6, 2003

Please read this License carefully before downloading this software.
By downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound
by the terms of this License.  If you do not or cannot agree to the
terms of this License, please do not download or use the software.

Apple Note:  In January 2007, Apple changed its corporate name from
"Apple Computer, Inc." to "Apple Inc."  This change has been reflected
below and copyright years updated, but no other changes have been
made to the APSL 2.0.

1.    General; Definitions.  This License applies to any program
or other work which Apple Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available
and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program
or work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the
terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 ("License").
As used in this License:

1.1     "Applicable Patent Rights" mean:  (a) in the case where
Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now
or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that
cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to
the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original
Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the
grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter
acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject
matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with
Original Code.

1.2    "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or
contributes to the creation of Modifications.

1.3     "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the
combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any
respective portions thereof.

1.4    "Externally Deploy" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or
otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to
anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as
part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including
but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication
with a client other than You.

1.5    "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or
portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.6    "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or
change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any
previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any
previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.
When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:  (a)
any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing
Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of
computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

1.7    "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or
other work as originally made available by Apple under this License,
including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs
or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has
been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s)
of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source
Code and originally made available by Apple under this License

1.8    "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or
other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an
executable (object code).

1.9    "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity
exercising rights under this License.  For legal entities, "You"
or "Your" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with, You, where "control" means (a) the
power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial
ownership of such entity.

2.    Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.   Subject to the
terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You,
effective on the date You accept this License and download the
Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license,
to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights
covering the Original Code, to do the following:

2.1    Unmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform,
internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally
Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for
commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:

(a)    You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code
the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple
as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices
in the Original Code that refer to this License; and

(b)     You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or
Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on
such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.

2.2    Modified Code.  You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce,
display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization,
and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for
commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance
You also meet all of these conditions:

(a)    You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with
respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;

(b)    You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist,
the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any
change; and

(c)    If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make
Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either
available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your
Modifications, or publicly available.  Source Code of Your Externally
Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth
in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section
3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or
twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment,
whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source
Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g.
download from a web site).

2.3    Distribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You
Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications)
in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent
notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the
terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain
such Source Code.

2.4    Third Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree
that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to
their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no
assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered
Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any
liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code,
it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
the Covered Code.

3.    Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any
person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this
License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable
license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual
property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to
use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute
and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and
extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.

4.    Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In
each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

5.    Limitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated
in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted
by Apple herein.  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require
additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its
sole discretion.

6.    Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted
herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered
Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your
sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor.
You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional
Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor
by reason of any such Additional Terms.

7.    Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or
new versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will
be given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has
been published under a particular version of this License, You may
continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent
version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
under this License.

8.    NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole
or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The
Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss
of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly
acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion
thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE COVERED CODE IS
PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY
KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO
AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT,
AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR
DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE
COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL
MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL
BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE
WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN
BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR
SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is
not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines
in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death,
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

9.    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW,
IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF
CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY
OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE
OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's
total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required
by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty
dollars ($50.00).

10.    Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use
the trademarks or trade names  "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime",
"QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks,
logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks")
or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to
any Contributor.  You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as
part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to
endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other
than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times
with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted
at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

11.    Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,
each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to
any Modifications made by such Contributor.  Apple retains all
rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any
Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"),
and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to
this License.  Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license
such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms
from those contained in this License or may choose not to license
them at all.

12.    Termination.

12.1    Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate:

(a)    automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply
with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within
30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b)    immediately in the
event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c)
automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during
the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action
for patent infringement against You in that instance.

12.2    Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to
immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,
sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code.  All sublicenses
to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to
termination shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions
which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections
3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  No party will be liable to any
other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as
a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms,
and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
other right or remedy of any party.

13.     Miscellaneous.

13.1    Government End Users.   The Covered Code is a "commercial
item" as defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical
data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily
provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary
commercial license in technical data and software is provided in
accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer
Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015
(Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in
Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).
Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
with only those rights set forth herein.

13.2    Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed
as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form
of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor,
and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
implication, appearance or otherwise.

13.3    Independent Development.   Nothing in this License will
impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others
develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products
that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete
with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You
may develop, produce, market or distribute.

13.4    Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple or any Contributor
to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver
of future enforcement of that or any other provision.  Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.

13.5    Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent
jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced
to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic
benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License
will continue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully
and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents
the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use
of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
possession or control.

13.6    Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute
resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall
take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple
hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the
state and federal courts within that District with respect to this
License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

13.7    Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the
United States and the State of California, except that body of
California law concerning conflicts of law.

Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
clause applies:  The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.
Les parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
connexes soient rediges en anglais.

to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date

for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your
own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of
Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall
be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms
or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
Licensor regarding such Contributions.

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
such warranty or additional liability.
