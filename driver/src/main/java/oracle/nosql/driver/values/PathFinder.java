/**
 * This class is used to find paths within an NSON document. Only simple
 * path expressions are supported and are treated as an array of strings,
 * one string for each path component. Future expansion to support
 * arrays or more complex paths may be added.
 * <p>
 * A single instance of the class is create for each search, with some
 * static convenience methods that wrap some searches.
 * <p>
 * A single search can include multiple paths to optimize the case where
 * more than one path needs to be found.
 * <p>
 * Convenience constructors exist for simple cases where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>only one path is used</li>
 *   <li> none of the path components contain the "." character, which can be
 *  used as a separator </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *
 *   // seek -- returns true if the specified path is found in the stream.
 *   //   On return the inputStream is positioned at the path if found.
 *   boolean found = PathFinder.seek("a.b.c", inputStream);
 *
 *   // find a single path, no handler set, stop when found
 *   PathFinder pf = new PathFinder(null, new String[]{"a", "b", "c"});
 *   pf.find(inputStream,
 *           (PathFinder pf, String[] path) -&gt; {
 *              System.out.println("Path found");
 *              pf.stop();
 *              return false;
 *           }
 *
 *   // find multiple paths, use a JsonSerializer handler, in the callback
 *   // skip the found paths, removing them from the JSON that is generated
 *   JsonSerializer js = new JsonPrettySerializer(null);
 *   List&lt;String[]&gt; paths = new ArrayList&lt;String[]&gt;();
 *   paths.add(new String[] {"a", "b", "path.dot"});
 *   paths.add(new String[] {"path2"});
 *   PathFinder pf = new PathFinder(js, paths);
 *   pf.find(inputStream, (PathFinder finder, String[] path)-&gt; {
 *       return true; // true means skip the field
 *   }
 *   // at this point js.toString() will have the JSON representation of
 *   // the NSON from the inputStream but without the 2 specified paths
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Think about (some of these apply to NSON in general and not this class):
 * <ul>
 *  <li>multi-path seek with ability to "continue"</li>
 *  <li>ability to find array fields (a.b[6], a[5].foo, etc) or maybe just
 *  convenience methods to move within arrays such as seek(5) to get to 5th
 *  element</li>
 *  <li>predicates/equality mechanism (think about abstractions that can be the
 *  underpinnings of query operations -- compare, arithmetic, other ops...)</li>
 *  <li>general query-ish support in this or related classes</li>
 *  <li>"index" style support that allows direct navigation to a field by
 *  setting an offset. That can be done in caller with bis but worth
 *  mentioning here</li>
 * </ul>
