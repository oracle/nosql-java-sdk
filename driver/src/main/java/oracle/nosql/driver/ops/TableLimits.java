/**
 * Cloud service only.
 * <p>
 * A TableLimits instance is used during table creation to specify the
 * throughput and capacity to be consumed by the table. It is also used
 * in an operation to change the limits of an existing table.
 * {@link NoSQLHandle#tableRequest} and {@link TableRequest} are used to
 * perform these operations. These values are enforced by the system and
 * used for billing purposes.
 * <p>
 * Throughput limits are defined in terms of read units and write units.  A
 * read unit represents 1 eventually consistent read per second for data up to
 * 1 KB in size. A read that is absolutely consistent is double that, consuming
 * 2 read units for a read of up to 1 KB in size. This means that if an
 * application is to use {@link Consistency#ABSOLUTE} it may need to specify
 * additional read units when creating a table. A write unit represents 1 write
 * per second of data up to 1 KB in size.
 * <p>
 * In addition to throughput table capacity must be specified to indicate
 * the maximum amount of storage, in gigabytes, allowed for the table.
 * <p>
 * All 3 values must be used whenever using this object. There are no defaults
 * and no mechanism to indicate "no change."
 *
