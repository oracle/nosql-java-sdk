/**
 * An instance of this class is created when a request is sent and is used to
 * collect response state. The instance is attached to a Channel's attribute
 * map, which means that this will work for HTTP/1.1 where channels are not
 * multiplexed, but will need to change for HTTP/2.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe but is used in a safe, single-threaded manner
 * mapped 1:1 with a channel associated with a single HTTP request/response
 * cycle.
 *
 * At this time this object does not aggregate chunks of content into a single
 * buffer. It is expected that this is done using an HttpContentAggregator in
 * the pipeline and is only called with a FullHttpResponse. If aggregation is
 * desired here it can be added using a CompositeByteBuf and calls to add
 * content incrementally.
