/**
 * Cloud service only.
 * <p>
 * An exception that is thrown when a non-data operation is throttled.
 * This can happen if an application attempts too many control operations
 * such as table creation, deletion, or similar methods. Such operations
 * do not use throughput or capacity provisioned for a given table but
 * they consume system resources and their use is limited.
 * <p>
 * Operations resulting in this exception can be retried but it is recommended
 * that callers use a relatively large delay before retrying in order to
 * minimize the chance that a retry will also be throttled.
