/**
 * RateLimiter interface provides default methods that all rate limiters
 * must implement.
 * <p>
 * In NoSQL Cloud, rate limiters are used internally in {@link NoSQLHandle}
 * operations when enabled using NoSQLHandleConfig#setRateLimitingEnabled}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Typical usage:</b>
 * The simplest use of the rate limiter is to consume a number of units,
 * blocking until they are successfully consumed:
 * <pre>
 *    int delayMs = rateLimiter.consumeUnits(units);
 *    // delayMs indicates how long the consume delayed
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * To poll a limiter to see if it is currently over the limit:
 * <pre>
 *    if (rateLimiter.tryConsumeUnits(0)) {
 *        // limiter is below its limit
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * To attempt to consume units, only if they can be immediately consumed
 * without waiting:
 * <pre>
 *    if (ratelimiter.tryConsumeUnits(units)) {
 *        // successful consume
 *    } else {
 *        // could not consume units without waiting
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Usages that involve waiting with timeouts:
 * <p>
 * In cases where the number of units an operation will consume is already
 * known before the operation, a simple one-shot method can be used:
 * <pre>
 *    long units = (known units the operation will use)
 *    try {
 *        boolean alwaysConsume=false; // don't consume if we time out
 *        int delayMs = rateLimiter.consumeUnitsWithTimeout(units,
 *                      timeoutMs, alwaysConsume);
 *        // we waited delayMs for the units to be consumed, and the
 *        // consume was successful
 *        ...do operation...
 *    } catch (TimeoutException e) {
 *        // we could not do the operation within the given timeframe.
 *        ...skip operation...
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In cases where the number of units an operation will consume is not
 * known before the operation, typically two rate limiter calls would be
 * used: one to wait till the limiter is below it limit, and a second
 * to update the limiter with used units:
 * <pre>
 *    // wait until we're under the limit
 *    try {
 *        // note here we don't consume units if we time out
 *        int delayMs = rateLimiter.consumeUnitsWithTimeout(0,
 *                      timeoutMs, false);
 *    } catch (TimeoutException e) {
 *        // we could not go below the limit within the given timeframe.
 *        ...skip operation...
 *    }
 *    // we waited delayMs to be under the limit, and were successful
 *    long units = ...do operation, get number of units used...
 *    // update rate limiter with consumed units. Next operation on this
 *    // limiter may delay due to it being over its limit.
 *    rateLimiter.consumeUnits(units);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Alternately, the operation could be always performed, and then the
 * limiter could try to wait for the units to be consumed:
 * <pre>
 *    long units = ...do operation, get number of units used...
 *    try {
 *        boolean alwaysConsume=true; // consume, even if we time out
 *        int delayMs = rateLimiter.consumeUnitsWithTimeout(units,
 *                      timeoutMs, alwaysConsume);
 *        // we waited delayMs for the units to be consumed, and the
 *        // consume was successful
 *    } catch (TimeoutException e) {
 *        // the rate limiter could not consume the units and go
 *        // below the limit in the given timeframe. Units are
 *        // consumed anyway, and the next call to this limiter
 *        // will likely delay
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Limiter duration</b>:
 * Implementing rate limiters should support a configurable "duration".
 * This is sometimes referred to as a "burst mode", or a "window time",
 * or "burst duration".
 * This will allow consumes of units that were not consumed in the recent
 * past. For example, if a limiter allows for 100 units per second, and is
 * not used for 5 seconds, it should allow an immediate consume of 500
 * units with no delay upon a consume call, assuming that the limiter's
 * duration is set to at least 5 seconds.
 * The maximum length of time for this duration should be configurable.
 * In all cases a limiter should set a reasonable minimum duration, such
 * that a call to <pre>tryConsumeUnits(1)</pre> has a chance of succeeding.
 * It is up to the limiter implementation to determine if units from the past
 * before the limiter was created or reset are available for use.
 * If a limiter implemetation does not allow setting a duration, it must throw
 * an UnsupportedOperationException when its setDuration() method is called.
