 * Operations resulting in this exception can be retried but it is recommended
 * that callers use a delay before retrying in order to minimize the chance
 * that a retry will also be throttled. Applications should attempt to avoid
 * throttling exceptions by rate limiting themselves to the degree possible.
 * <p>
 * Retries and behavior related to throttling can be managed by configuring
 * the default retry handler using
 * {@link NoSQLHandleConfig#configureDefaultRetryHandler} or by implementing
 * a {@link RetryHandler} and using {@link NoSQLHandleConfig#setRetryHandler}.
