/**
 * NoSQLHandle is a handle that can be used to access Oracle NoSQL tables. To
 * create a connection represented by NoSQLHandle, request an instance using
 * {@link NoSQLHandleFactory#createNoSQLHandle} and {@link NoSQLHandleConfig},
 * which allows an application to specify default values and other configuration
 * information to be used by the handle.
 * <p>
 * The same interface is available to both users of the Oracle NoSQL Database
 * Cloud Service and the on-premise Oracle NoSQL Database; however, some methods
 * and/or parameters are specific to each environment. The documentation has notes
 * about whether a class, method, or parameter is environment-specific. Unless
 * otherwise noted they are applicable to both environments.
 * <p>
 * A handle has memory and network resources associated with it.
 * Consequently, the {@link NoSQLHandle#close} method must be invoked to free up
 * the resources when the application is done using the handle.  <p> To
 * minimize network activity as well as resource allocation and deallocation
 * overheads, it's best to avoid repeated creation and closing of handles. For
 * example, creating and closing a handle around each operation, would incur
 * large resource allocation overheads resulting in poor application
 * performance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A handle permits concurrent operations, so a single handle is sufficient to
 * access tables in a multi-threaded application. The creation of multiple
 * handles incurs additional resource overheads without providing any
 * performance benefit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With the exception of {@link #close} the operations on this interface follow
 * a similar pattern. They accept a {@link Request} object containing
 * parameters, both required and optional. They return a {@link Result} object
 * containing results. Operation failures throw exceptions. Unique subclasses
 * of {@link Request} and {@link Result} exist for most operations, containing
 * information specific to the operation. All of these operations result in
 * remote calls across a network.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All {@link Request} instances support specification of parameters for the
 * operation as well as the ability to override default parameters which may
 * have been specified in {@link NoSQLHandleConfig}, such as request timeouts,
 * {@link Consistency}, etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Objects returned by methods of this interface can only be used safely by
 * one thread at a time unless synchronized externally. {@link Request} objects
 * are not copied and must not be modified by the application while a method
 * on this interface is using them.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Error and Exception Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * On success all methods in this interface return {@link Result} objects.
 * Errors are thrown as exceptions.  Some Java exceptions, such as {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException} and {@link NullPointerException} are thrown
 * directly. All other exceptions are instances of {@link NoSQLException},
 * which serves as a base class for NoSQL Database exceptions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link NoSQLException} instances are split into 2 broad categories:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Exceptions that may be retried with the expectation that they
 * may succeed on retry. These are instances of {@link RetryableException}</li>
 * <li> Exceptions that may not be retried and if retried, will fail again</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Exceptions that may be retried return true for
 * {@link NoSQLException#okToRetry} while those that may not will return false.
 * Examples of retryable exceptions are those which indicate resource
 * consumption violations such as {@link ThrottlingException}.
 * Examples of exceptions that should not be
 * retried are {@link IllegalArgumentException},
 * {@link TableNotFoundException}, and any other exception indicating a
 * syntactic or semantic error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of NoSQLHandle are thread-safe and expected to be shared among
 * threads.
 * </p>
